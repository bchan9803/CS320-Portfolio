### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- I've ensured that my program is functional by designing the unit cases in a way that result in the highest code coverage possible. This will lead to code that can accomdate almost every input. In addition to this, I can develop a secure program by implementing a solid testing strategy that will test for almost every input. Also, I can have the program throw exceptions to handle inputs that result in error.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- By taking the time to acquire and understand the needs of the user, the developer can then implement those requirements into the program. This is evident in the program, where I fufilled the requirement of having a code coverage above 80% by creating unit cases that could handle every input. This resulted the program having an almost 100% code coverage.

### How do I approach designing software?
- Fufilling the software's requirements should be a top priority for the developer. This should influence the developer's approach to designing software. In the context of this program, I satsfied the program's requirements of having test classes by creating Java classes that utilized JUnit5, which would then be used to test the program. The classes were designed in a way to accomdate the testing from JUnit5, in addition to using a custom exception class to handle invalid inputs.
